# Java Game README

## Overview
This is a Java game developed collaboratively. The game runs as a standalone Java application and can be executed in an IDE like Eclipse. Once extracted and set up correctly, simply running the main program will launch the game.

## Installation & Setup
1. Extract the ZIP file containing all assets and source code.
2. Open Eclipse (or another Java IDE).
3. Import the project:
   - In Eclipse, go to `File` > `Open Projects from File System...` and select the extracted folder.
   - Alternatively, create a new Java project and copy the source files into the `src` folder.
4. Ensure Java is installed (JDK 8 or higher).
5. Run the game:
   - Locate the main class (`Interface.java`).
   - Right-click and select `Run As > Java Application`.

## Controls

- X - Pick Up Item

## Dependencies
- No external libraries are required.
- All assets (images, sounds, etc.) are included in the ZIP file and should be in the correct directories after extraction.

## Troubleshooting
